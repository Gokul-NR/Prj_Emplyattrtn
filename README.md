PROJECT: EMPLOYEE ATTRITION ANALYSIS & PREDICTION

REQUIREMENTS:

Please refer the document named “Emplyattrtn-prjrqrmnt” attached above.

APPROACH:

•	Cleaned data by looking for null, missing values and unknown values like Nan
•	Identified the presence of any ordinal and categorical variables
•	Performed one-hot encoding to aid the model for better data handling
•	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify the correlations and key factors influencing the attrition rate (Target)
•	Selected key features related to the target variable for model building
•	Checked for data balance and under sampling technique was executed to improve the accuracy of the ML model
•	Chose appropriate ML algorithm using lazy predict
•	Built Logistic Regression Model and trained using training data set
•	Evaluated the model using test data set
•	Saved the model using pickle
•	Loaded model in Streamlit and designed dashboard that enables user (HR) to enter the values of the features and predict the Attrition Rate
•	Deployment steps and instructions to enter data and accuracy of the model has been shared below
•	Inference and Suggestions to HR (by predicting Attrition using the ML model) has been shared in a separate file
